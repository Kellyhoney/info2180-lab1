        <h4>Who Am I?</h4>
    
        <p>My name is <b>Shantay Kellyman</b>, and I come from Kingston, Jamaica. I began my educational journey at <u> Holy Childhood Preparatory School</u>, where I built the foundation for my future. In grade 4, I transitioned to <u>Wolmer's Preparatory School</u>, taking on new challenges with determination and enthusiasm. Continuing my education at <u>Immaculate Conception High School</u>, I further honed my skills and nurtured my passions. Now, as I pursue higher education at the <u>University of the West Indies</u> Mona campus, I am determined to graduate with dual degrees in Marketing and Computer Science. With each step forward, I am motivated by how Marketing and Computer Science will allow me to blend creativity and technical knowledge, to make a meaningful impact in both the business and technology sectors.</p>
